#Simple Calculator (Python)


Overview
This is a basic command-line calculator written in Python. The program allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations between two numbers. The user is prompted to select an operation, input two numbers, and the program will calculate and display the result. The calculator can be used multiple times in a single session, with an option to exit.

Features
Four basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
Input validation: Prompts users to enter valid choices and numerical values.
Repeatable calculations: The program asks the user if they wish to continue or exit after each calculation.
User-friendly interface: Accepts operation input by both number and name (e.g., "1" or "a" for addition).
Technologies Used
Python: Core logic for handling user input, performing arithmetic operations, and controlling the program flow.
